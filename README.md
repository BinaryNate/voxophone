# Voxophone UI

Voxophone is a mobile app which turns your singing or humming into realistic instrument sounds, like a keyboard that you play with your voice instead of your fingers.

Voxophone is currently pending approval for the Apple App Store and will be coming soon to the Google Play store, too.

## Code

This repo contains the source code for Voxophone's user interface, which is built with [NativeScript](https://docs.nativescript.org/), an excellent library for developing native, cross-platform mobile apps using JavaScript, CSS, and XML. This code is open source to be used as a reference for:

- developers interested in using NativeScript
- NativeScript developers interested in using my [nativescript-component](https://github.com/BinaryNate/nativescript-component) library for creating reusable UI components
- people interested in learning programming in general

While this repo contains Voxophone's user interface, it does not include its proprietary audio engine, which is required to be able to build and run the app. So, this code is provided for informational purposes, but cannot be built as-is.
